# api

## Responsibility

The `api` component defines two FastAPI applications: the inventory service surface and an
inventory-owned orders surface. It also keeps the inventory REST contract in an OpenAPI document.
The handlers currently return placeholder data and do not show wiring to the database, queue,
storage, event, or client modules.

## Interfaces

The component produces the owned `inventory-api` and `orders-api` REST interfaces. See
[interfaces.md](../interfaces.md) for the indexed entries.

## Key modules

- `inventory/api/openapi.yaml` — OpenAPI 3.0.3 contract for inventory listing, item updates,
  reservations, and releases.
- `inventory/api/routes.py` — FastAPI application and inventory route handlers.
- `inventory/api/orders_routes.py` — FastAPI application and `/orders` route handlers for the
  inventory-owned orders surface.

## Configuration

The API modules do not read environment variables, command-line flags, or application config
files. FastAPI application titles and versions are defined in the module source.

## Failure modes

`get_inventory_item` raises an HTTP 404 for an unknown SKU. The other handlers return their
placeholder responses without connecting to the repository's data or integration modules. No
logging, metrics, or alert configuration is present in these files.
